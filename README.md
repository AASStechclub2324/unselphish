## Troubleshooting

While Unselphish is designed to provide comprehensive analysis and protection against spam and phishing attacks, we understand that there might be occasional challenges. One situation to note is when non-embedded links in text messages are not detected by the program.

### Issue: Non-Embedded Links

**Problem**: Unselphish might not be able to analyze non-embedded links present in text messages.

**Solution**: If you encounter a non-embedded link that doesn't seem to be detected by Unselphish, we recommend taking the following steps:

1. **Separate Scan**: Copy the link from the text and navigate to Unselphish's web app. Submit the link separately for scanning. This will ensure that the link is thoroughly analyzed for any potential threats.

2. **Provide Feedback**: If you come across any issues or inconsistencies, please don't hesitate to reach out to our team. Your feedback is invaluable for our ongoing improvement efforts.

We want to assure you that we are continuously working to enhance Unselphish's capabilities. While non-embedded links may occasionally present challenges, we are committed to providing you with the best possible protection against spam and phishing attacks.
